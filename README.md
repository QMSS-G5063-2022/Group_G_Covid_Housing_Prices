This project aims to explore how the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the housing market by focusing on comparing the sales price across NYC. The project will track how the waves of Covid-19 cases affected the price fluctuations by conducting data analysis on quarterly tabular, spatial and text data, with illustrations.

Research Questions:
* How has Covid-19 affected the housing market via housing prices over time?
* How has COVID-19 affected the NYC housing market? Are there any regional variations in the housing price fluctuations?
* How has the overall perspective on Covid-19 changed over time?

## Part 1: Trends in Covid-19 and Sales Price

Part 1 examines Covid-19 rate and sales prices in all five boroughs in NYC from the 3rd quarter of 2020 to the 1st quarter of 2022. `ggplot2` and `ggplotly` in R is used to create the visualizations.

## Part 2: Geographical Variations

This section maps out the changes in the NYC Covid-19 case rates and housing prices by quarter using `ggplot2`. Specific neighborhoods are consulted from the analysis.

Two hypothesis are tested in this section:

1. The association between Covid-19 and housing prices is negative.
2. The association between Covid-19 and housing prices is positive.

## Part 3: Text Analysis

The final section studies the changes of perspective on Covid-19 over time (2020 Q3 vs. 2021 Q4) by conducting sentiment analysis and creating word clouds using Python.
